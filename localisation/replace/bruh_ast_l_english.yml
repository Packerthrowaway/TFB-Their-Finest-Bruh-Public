  AST_australian_self_reliance_desc:0 "Australia is large, yet still relies on imports of rubber, and oil. We have large mineral deposits, but too little refining.

  AST_secure_our_own_defence:0 "Secure Our Own Defence"
  AST_secure_our_own_defence_desc:0 "The UK is on the other side of the world and cannot be relied upon to come to our aid in times of need. Australia needs to prepare her own defences instead of sending troops half a world away."

  AST_prepare_for_the_northern_threat_desc:0 "It is clear that Japan will use the war in Europe as an opportunity to attack the neglected European colonial possessions in South-East Asia. We must construct defensive structures to stop them in their tracks."
  AST_national_direction_of_investment:0 "National Direction of Investment"

This applies to industry as a whole; to commerce; to finance; and to all the various interests and sections of our society."

  ### Events ####
  tfb_australia.1.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Proposal about West Papau"
  tfb_australia.1.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has initiated negotiations with [Root.GetAdjective] diplomats for the potential transfer of responsibility over the protection of [Root.GetAdjective] territory in Southeast Asia.\n\nConsidering the challenges inherent in defending said territory, a partnership may not be such a bad idea. It would mean that for the foreseeable future said territory would only be nominally [Root.GetAdjective], but nominal ownership is surely better than completely losing them."
  tfb_australia.1.a:0 "Australia should provide the first line of defense in Southeast Asia."
  tfb_australia.1.b:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] territory will remain in [Root.GetAdjective] hands!"
  tfb_australia.2.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Transfers Colonial Holdings"
  tfb_australia.2.d:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] troops stood ready to assume responsibilities for the protection of all [From.GetAdjective] territory in Southeast Asia as soon as [From.GetLeader] approved the agreement.\n\nWhile some local resistance was met in the transfer, fear of foreign aggression ensures that most recognize the need for [Root.GetAdjective] defense."
  tfb_australia.2.a:0 "We will not disappoint."
  tfb_australia.3.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Rejects Strategic Adjustments"
  tfb_australia.3.d:0 "Believing themselves to be sufficiently capable of protecting [From.GetAdjective] territory in Southeast Asia, [From.GetNameDef] has refused our proposal of a shared defense strategy.\n\nUndoubtedly motivated by worries of colonial control, their actions are understandable. However, if they are incapable of protecting their territory - as we fear - we may see it used as the launch platform for an attack on the Australian continent."
  tfb_australia.3.a:0 "We can only hope they will be able to resist."

  tfb_australia.4.t:0 "Review our Position"
  tfb_australia.4.d:0 "The war has escalated on a global level. Strategies have changed, plans have been altered and we need to decide where we are needed the most. Shall we be lead by Menzies European focus, or Curtin's Pacific focus?"
