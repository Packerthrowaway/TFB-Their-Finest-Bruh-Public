  GER_rearm_slow_desc:0 "It is through economies of scale that we shall emerge victorious in the long-term. A perfect blitzkrieg may sound appealing, but in the event we must fight a war of attrition, we must be ready. The choice is clear."

His vision is to make Germany a fortress that can withstand any assault, but his methods can be wasteful and impractical. As long as the Führer tolerates him, Todt will continue to push his ambitious plans, regardless of their feasibility. But if the military situation worsens, Todt's position may become untenable.
