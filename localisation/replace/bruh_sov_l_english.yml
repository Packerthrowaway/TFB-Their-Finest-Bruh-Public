  SOV_army_tank_04_desc:0 "The new armored doctrine requires superior battlefield coordination. Our divisions will learn to move faster and fight smarter, allowing them to rapidly exploit any breakthrough created by the initial assault."
  SOV_army_tank_05:0 "Mechanized Wave"
  SOV_army_tank_05_desc:0 "Our tanks and mechanized infantry will be trained to fight as a single, overwhelming wave. This improves the combat power of both unit types, but their reliance on this tactic will make them less effective at digging in."
  SOV_army_tank_06:0 "Breakthrough Priority"
  SOV_army_tank_06_desc:0 "All efforts will be focused on the breakthrough. Our armored forces will learn to plan attacks with incredible speed, supported by our air force. This frantic pace comes at the cost of careful, long term planning."
  SOV_army_tank_07:0 "The Armored Officer Corps"
  SOV_army_tank_07_desc:0 "This final reform ensures our command staff is fully indoctrinated in armored warfare. All our army leaders will be trained in offensive and defensive tank tactics, creating a new generation of elite commanders."
  SOV_army_germans_are_coming_01:0 "Germans are Coming"
  SOV_army_germans_are_coming_01_desc:0 "The fascist hordes are at the gates. Our previous reforms are not enough to stop them.

  SOV_army_germans_are_coming_02:0 "Anti-Air Coordination"
  SOV_army_germans_are_coming_02_desc:0 "To coordinate our vast front, we will establish the Stavka, a new General Headquarters for the Armed Forces. This body will improve our operational planning and our army's ability to resist enemy air power."
  SOV_army_germans_are_coming_03:0 "Restore the Dual Command"
  SOV_army_germans_are_coming_03_desc:0 "Enemy dive bombers are a terror to our ground troops.

This new doctrine will improve our army's ability to withstand air attacks."
  SOV_army_germans_are_coming_04:0 "Promote New Talent"
  SOV_army_germans_are_coming_04_desc:0 "The old guard is not enough. We must rapidly promote new, talented officers like Georgy Zhukov to high command. This new policy will drastically reduce the cost of promoting experienced commanders."
  SOV_mil1:0 "Reorganize the Defense Industry"

  SOV_fix_airforce_desc:0 "The crucible of war is the ultimate teacher, and we must now systematize the hard-won lessons of the front lines. By establishing proper radio networks, reforming our command structure, and discarding political theory in favor of combat reality, we will forge an air force capable of challenging the Luftwaffe."
  SOV_fix_cas:0 "Flying Artillery"
  SOV_fix_cas_desc:0 "For too long, our bombers have struck well behind the lines, leaving our infantry exposed to the Fascist Panzers. This changes now. We are instituting strict new training for Direct Air Support. Our Sturmoviks must act as flying tanks, coordinating directly with forward ground controllers to smash enemy strongpoints meters ahead of our advancing troops."
  SOV_fix_fighters:0 "New Fighter Tactics"
  SOV_fix_fighters_desc:0 "Our defensive, three plane formations are suicide against experienced German aces. To clear the skies, we must adopt more aggressive tactics.

  SOV_slacken_training_standarts:0 "Rush Training Programs"
  SOV_slacken_training_standarts_desc:0 "We cannot afford the luxury of 6-month boot camps. Recruits need to know how to shoot, how to dig, and how to obey. Cut the training time drastically, the survivors will learn the rest on the battlefield."
  SOV_new_leadership:0 "Promote Meritocracy"
  SOV_new_leadership_desc:0 "The war has exposed the incompetent sycophants in our ranks. We must drastically lower the barriers to promotion, allowing talented commanders like Zhukov to rise to the top regardless of their political standing."

  SOV_pol_purge2:0 "The All Seeing Eyes"

  SOV_pol_purge5:0 "Opium of the People"
  SOV_pol_purge5_desc:0 "Religion dulls the minds of the workers, turning their eyes from the struggle on earth to false hopes in the heavens. It is a relic of the old order, a poison that numbs the will to build socialism. The time has come to tear down the altars and silence the priests, so that the people may awaken to the only truth that matters: The triumph of the Revolution."
  SOV_pol_purge6:0 "Medicine of the People"
  SOV_pol_purge6_desc:0 "While religion can dull the minds of the masses, it can also be shaped to serve the Revolution.

Faith, properly managed, need not be an enemy of socialism."

  SOV_pol_purge13:0 "Preserve the High Command"
  SOV_pol_purge13_desc:0 "Rather than tearing the Red Army apart through suspicion and denunciation, we will maintain unity and discipline among the Marshalate. By sparing Tukhachevsky and Blyukher, we signal trust in our military leadership but risk empowering rivals within the Party and Army."

He actively worked to slow down the production of T34 and KV1 tank series by using his position to slow down the production of ammo for the tanks. §G"What the hell do we need rocket artillery for? The main thing is the horse-drawn gun."§! He failed to prevent the encirclement of Lenningrad and was dismissed in 41 along with Voroshilov.\n\nHis path is only accessible by Winning the Winter War without needing the buff the Soviets get at half casualties. His path grants Calvary or TD bonuses, and picking him under the Voroshilov path focuses on Heavy Artillery"
  soviet.3001.t:0 "Who was Killment Voroshilov?"
  soviet.3001.d:0 "Killment Voroshilov was a more political guy, he was incompetent but was good politically and so survived his poor performance in WW even though people didn't like him much. He was still made the scapegoat though and was made to be 'Deputy Premier responsible for cultural matters' and while given command again after Barbarossa after his failure to prevent the encirclement of Lenningrad he was dismissed by Zhukov in 41 along with Khulik.\n\nWinning the winter war will allow you to go down his path, focused on Heavy Artillery or Light Tanks, or a neutral path with no specialization. Picking him under Timeshenko will also lead to that neutral path."
  soviet.3002.t:0 "Who was Semyon Timoshenko?"
  soviet.3002.d:0 "Semyon Timoshenko was the Marshall brought in to salvage the Winter War after Voroshilov's Failing's, and was able to organize a succesfull soviet series of offensives to win the war. While more traditional minded than the other reformists, he nontheless saw a need to modernize the Soviet Military. He was initially assigned the center during the defense of Barbarossa but was eventually given control of the entire southern half of the front when Zhokov was given control of the North.\n\nHis path is the historical path and is always available, granting more generic bonuses. You may also get Blyukher with this path."
  soviet.3003.t:0 "Who was Vasily Blyukher?"
  soviet.3003.d:0 "Vasily Blyukher was a field marshal who was a reformer of Soviet Doctrine. He was close friends with Tuchchekvsky and believed in the modernization of the army. He was the first Soviet Officer to use Aircraft to scout for artillery. He was in charge of the Far East during the border war in the Battle of Lake Khasan, and the soviet unpreparedness there caused him to get purged.\n\nYou can choose to keep Bluhkyr in the semi-historical path, or you can take full control with him if the winter war is lost by the leaders of the traditional russian tactics. He goes heavy into the Modernization of the Soviet Army and grants lots of bonuses to that end. You can also save Tuchchekvsky with his path."
  soviet.3004.t:0 "Who was Semyon Budyonny?"
  soviet.3004.d:0 "Semyon Budyonny was an old fart Calvary leader who believed speed was the most important thing and was generally incomptenet. He was the one responsible for the encirclements at Kiev and while removed from Active Military Service Stalin kep him from being purged. §G"Budyonny never knew much, and he never studied anything. He showed himself to be completely incompetent and permitted awful mistakes to be made." - Konev§!\n\nUnder Khulik his path is to focus on Calvary, and under the Voroshilov path his focus is on the BT Program of light tanks"
  soviet.3005.t:0 "Who was Alexander Yegorov?"
  soviet.3005.d:0 "Alexander Yegorov was a Field Marshall who was purged in 1939, and believed that tanks were over-rated. He believed that the future was in Mobile Anti Tank guns and better hand-held Anti-Tank equipment. He only survived the purges as long as he did due to a personal connection with Stalin but his perofrmance during the Polish Soviet War from the 20's was recieving considerable rebuke and thus he was killed.\n\nHis path grants bonuses to Tank Destorers and AT equipment."
  soviet.3006.t:0 "Who was Mikhail Tukhachevsky?"
  soviet.3006.d:0 "Mikhail Tukhachevsky was a reform minded Soviet Field Marshal who heavily pushed the Deep Operations style of doctrine and pushed for the strong need for Modernization of the soviet Army. His work was slowly being incorporated into Soviet Doctrine but was stalled when he was purged in 1937.\n\nIf during the "Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization" you elect to have Trostky Spared for the Stability hit, you can have him as an option if you lose the Winter War."

  soviet.3008.t:0 "Losing the Winter War"
  soviet.3008.d:0 "To be blunt, this path is only designed for soviets who are playing poorly and will need a boost to ensure they don't get crushed when Barb happens. They are given good field marshalls and stats to make up for their poor performance. It would not be unreasonable for some servers to choose to ban this path depending on their play preference."
