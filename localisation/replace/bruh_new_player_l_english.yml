  newPlayer.1.t:0 "Combat Width and Templates"
  newPlayer.1.d:0 "TFB uses the older combat width system with multiples of 10, leading to good defending divisions being 20 width and good attacking divisions being 30 width (in general).\n\nNote that there are more support companies and unit types in TFB than in Vanilla, but a template of\n\n8 infantry brigades\n2 artillery brigades\n2 anti-tank brigades\n\nis a decent generic template for infantry. Some may choose 2 less artillery/at for an extra infantry brigade depending on their opponent."

During the Winter War your goal is to deal as much damage to the soviets as you can without taking too much damage yourself.\n\nYour primary goal should be to not have any divisions encircled, as it is expected you will lose and you need to conserve strength for the Eastern Front.

During the Winter War your goal is to break Finland with minimal casualties.\n\nIf possible, try to encircle and kill as many finnish divisions as possible as they will be back for round 2 soon. If you are struggling you have focuses which will give you a small stat boost against Finland after a certain amount of casualties.\n\nBe warned that losing the winter war will incur a penalty to Consumer Goods, Stability, and War Support.

  newPlayer.13.t:0 "France Paths"
  newPlayer.13.d:0 "France has 3 paths you can go down from left to right: Democratic, Socialist, Conservative. Going Left Left to 'Nationalize Key Industry' for the Democratic Path is Historical. Socialist path provides some extra industry in Africa for after capping but a weaker pre-cap. Conservative France provides a stronger France at the expense of a weaker Free-France, as you don't get to use the Industry tree on the left side."

  newPlayer.14.t:0 "France Capitulation"
  newPlayer.14.d:0 "France is designed to keep all of their forces in Europe before they capitulate, and will be given troops based on how well they fought Germany.

The Entire economy tree (light, heavy, defense) and all decisions §Rlock on Barb start§W, which means you need to think about what focuses you need done. You can access the light/heavy/defense decisions in the GOSPLAN decision menu via clicking the 3 different blue buttons that look like economy law icons.\n\nThe Regional Development Mechanic can be found in the GOSPLAN decisions, where you will find 12 areas with their respective levels and upgrade progress. These levels are reflected in state modifiers, which get better the higher the level is. To upgrade a region, do focuses or decisions and click the upgrade button (yellow up arrow).

  newPlayer.19.t:0 "Industrial Evacuation Mechanic"
  newPlayer.19.d:0 "With the start of the Great Patriotic War, the USSR will dismantle its industry in the west and transport it to the Urals and Siberia. This is a critical mechanic for preserving its long-term capabilities to wage war and prevent germany from siezing its industrial capabilities.\n\n§RHow it Works:§!\nEvacuation occurs in three distinct geographical waves, moving from west to east. All areas will immediatly upon the start of operation barbarossa begin evacuation, starting their respective timers. If the timer of an area runs out, every controlled state in this area will evactuate 1 factory each to Asia, and then restart. The timers will automatically restart and keep evactuating facotries until either all land in that area is lost the germans or there are no more factoriesl left. If you lose a state before the timer finishes, the factories inside are lost to the axi.\n\n§RHighlighting States:§!\nTo help you plan, there are three decisions in your decision tab: 'First Wave 1 Evacuation States', 'Second Wave', etc. Clicking these highlights the specific states on the map that belong to that wave.\n\n§RGoals for Axis:§! Speed is key. Use your superior armies to overrun soviet forces in these regions, stopping the evaciations before they can finishing and siezing the factories for your own war machine.\n\n§RGoals for USSR:§! Trade land for time. Try to hold onto every valuable state for as long as possible in order to evacuate as many factories as you can. Do not let your valuable industrial centres fall to the Axis without resistance. In addition, the evacuation effort will use up 300 trains. Finishing / Failing each evac will give back 100 trains, so be prepared for this."
